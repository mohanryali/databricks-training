# Concepts Practiced

## LEFT JOIN
Used to display all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

## RIGHT JOIN
Used to display all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

## FULL OUTER JOIN
Used to display all matching and unmatched rows from both tables.

## CROSS JOIN
Used to generate every possible combination between two tables.
